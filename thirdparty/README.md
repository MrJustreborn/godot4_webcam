## embree

- Upstream: https://github.com/embree/embree
- Version: 3.13.1 (12b99393438a4cc9e478e33459eed78bec6233fd, 2021)
- License: Apache 2.0

Files extracted from upstream:

- All cpp files listed in `modules/raycast/godot_update_embree.py`
- All header files in the directories listed in `modules/raycast/godot_update_embree.py`

The `modules/raycast/godot_update_embree.py` script can be used to pull the
relevant files from the latest Embree release and apply some automatic changes.

Some changes have been made in order to remove exceptions and fix minor build errors.
They are marked with `// -- GODOT start --` and `// -- GODOT end --`
comments. Apply the patches in the `patches/` folder when syncing on newer upstream
commits.


## enet

- Upstream: http://enet.bespin.org
- Version: 1.3.17 (e0e7045b7e056b454b5093cb34df49dc4cee0bee, 2020)
- License: MIT

Files extracted from upstream source:

- all .c files in the main directory (except unix.c win32.c)
- the include/enet/ folder as enet/ (except unix.h win32.h)

Important: enet.h, host.c, protocol.c have been slightly modified
to be usable by Godot's socket implementation and allow IPv6 and DTLS.
Apply the patches in the `patches/` folder when syncing on newer upstream
commits.

Three files (godot.cpp, enet/godot.h, enet/godot_ext.h) have been added to provide
enet socket implementation using Godot classes.

It is still possible to build against a system wide ENet but doing so
will limit its functionality to IPv4 only.
