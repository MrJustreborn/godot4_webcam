	<description>
		World boundary shape for 3D collisions. It works like an infinite plane and will not allow any physics body to go to the negative side. Note that the [Plane]'s normal matters; anything "below" the plane will collide with it. If the [WorldBoundaryShape3D] is used in a [PhysicsBody3D], it will cause colliding objects placed "below" it to teleport "above" the plane.
