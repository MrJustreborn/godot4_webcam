		One-shot timer.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A one-shot timer managed by the scene tree, which emits [signal timeout] on completion. See also [method SceneTree.create_timer].
		As opposed to [Timer], it does not require the instantiation of a node. Commonly used to create a one-shot delay timer as in the following example:
		[codeblocks]
		[gdscript]
		func some_function():
		    print("Timer started.")
		    yield(get_tree().create_timer(1.0), "timeout")
		    print("Timer ended.")
		[/gdscript]
		[csharp]
		public async void SomeFunction()
		{
		    GD.Print("Timer started.");
		    await ToSignal(GetTree().CreateTimer(1.0f), "timeout");
		    GD.Print("Timer ended.");
		}
		[/csharp]
		[/codeblocks]
