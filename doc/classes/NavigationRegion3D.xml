		A region of the navigation map.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A region of the navigation map. It tells the [NavigationServer3D] what can be navigated and what cannot, based on its [NavigationMesh] resource.
		Two regions can be connected to each other if they share a similar edge. You can set the minimum distance between two vertices required to connect two edges by using [method NavigationServer3D.map_set_edge_connection_margin].

	<methods>
		<method name="bake_navigation_mesh">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Bakes the [NavigationMesh]. The baking is done in a separate thread because navigation baking is not a cheap operation. This can be done at runtime. When it is completed, it automatically sets the new [NavigationMesh].
